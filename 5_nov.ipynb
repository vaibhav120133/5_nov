    "The substitution method for this type of recurrence doesn't directly apply because the subproblem size (n-1) isn't a constant multiple of the original size (n). This kind of recurrence typically represents a linear relationship and is often solved using iteration or summation techniques.\n",

    "b. T(n) = 2T(n/2) + n\n",
    "\n",
    "This recurrence relation is well-suited for the substitution method. Here's the solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "Base Case: We need a base case to stop the recursion. Let's assume T(1) = b (where b is a constant). This base case represents the time taken for the smallest input size (n = 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "Substitution:\n",
    "\n",
    "Express T(n) in terms of smaller subproblems: T(n) = 2T(n/2) + n\n",
    "Substitute T(n/2) using the base case (if n/2 is less than or equal to 1):\n",
    "If n/2 <= 1, then T(n/2) = b (base case)\n",
    "Substitute this back into the original equation: T(n) = 2 * b + n\n",
    "Solve the Recurrence:\n",
    "\n",
    "We now have a linear relationship between T(n) and n. We can solve this using summation: T(n) = 2b + n (from step 2)\n",
    "To account for all the subproblems from n/2 down to 1, we can sum this expression from k = 1 to k = log2(n) (since n/2^log2(n) = 1): Total Time = T(n) = Σ (2b + k) from k = 1 to k = log2(n)\n",
    "This summation telescopes (many terms cancel out): Total Time = 2b * log2(n) + (log2(n) + 1)\n",
    "Therefore, the solution for T(n) in this case is T(n) = 2b * log2(n) + (log2(n) + 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "c. T(n) = 2T(n/2) + c\n",
    "\n",
    "This recurrence relation is very similar to case (b). The only difference is the constant term c instead of n. The solution approach remains the same:\n",

    "If n/2 <= 1, then T(n/2) = b (base case)\n",
    "Substitute: T(n) = 2b + c\n",
    "Solve the Recurrence:\n",
    "T(n) = 2b + c (from step 2)\n",
    "Summation from k = 1 to k = log2(n): Total Time = T(n) = Σ (2b + c) from k = 1 to k = log2(n)\n",

    "d. T(n) = T(n/2) + c\n",
    "\n",
    "The constant term c in the subproblem (T(n/2)) makes the direct application of the substitution method less straightforward. However, we can still analyze the time complexity using the Master Theorem (if applicable) or other techniques depending on the specific problem context."

    "We can calculate the total cost by summing the costs at each level. However, for this type of tree (divide-and-conquer with constant additional cost), a more efficient approach is to use the Akra-Bazzi Theorem (a more general version of the Master Theorem).\n",
    "The Akra-Bazzi Theorem provides a closed-form solution for this kind of recurrence. It involves analyzing the growth rate of the additional cost (n / 2^i) compared to the size of the subproblems (n / 2^i). In this case, the additional cost grows slower than the subproblem size (logarithmic vs. linear).\n",

    "Key points to remember for using the recursive tree method:\n",
